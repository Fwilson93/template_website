## Professional Service
### Equality Diversity and Inclusivity
I sit on the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity committee of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. As a committee we contribute to Faculty EDI Community of Practice events, act as a task and finish group to address EDI issues at the School and Faculty level and act as the EDI points of contact for the School. In this role I have recently won independent funding to become trained as a Mental Health First Aid instructor. This will allow the School to deliver bespoke MHFA courses to staff in safeguarding roles, particularly fieldwork and student supervision.

### Mineral Physics Special Interest Group
As chair of the <a href="https://www.minersoc.org/mpg.html"> Mineral Physics Special Interest Group Mineralogical Society of the UK and Ireland</a>, I coordinate an exemplary group of Earth scientists with a shared passion for mineral physics. We organise yearly <a href="https://minphys.github.io/"> Research in Progress meetings, the next of which will be held in Edinburgh on April 9th-10th 2025</a>, and help coordinate <a href="https://www.minersoc.org/mpg-bursaries.html">travel bursaries</a> for early career researchers, both of which aim to promote and integrate early career researchers in the field of mineral physics.

### Reviewing
I take great pride in offering constructive and thoughtful reviews for my peers. It is an honour and a privilege to review for journals and organisations such as Nature Geosciences, Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, Geophysical Journal International (Outstanding Reviewer 2023), Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Scientific Reports, the National Science Foundation and the L’Oréal For women in science award.
